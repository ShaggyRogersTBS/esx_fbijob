# esx_fbijob
A rework of the popular esx_policejob, mixed with the old esx_fbijob which i made so that fbi can use on my server since the old one used 0.30ms. Instead, this one uses 0.03ms which is a lot more server friendly.

# LICENSE
I didn't ask the creators of the 2 scripts because i didn't think i would be doing something like this, will ask them for sure in the future.

# INSTALL
For the installation simply drag & drop the esx_fbijob folder into your resources folder, import the .sql in either English or Bulgarian and add the script to the server.cfg file.

# BUGS
Contact me for anything that buggs out, so i can fix it!!!
